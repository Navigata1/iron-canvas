# MOTION BUDGET
## *Iron Canvas — Phase 2 Integration*

> Motion without budget is noise.
> Every Iron Canvas build defines what moves, what anchors, and what costs too much
> before a single line of GSAP is written.

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

High-end motion design is NOT about animating everything.
It is about intentional contrast between what moves and what stays still.
The still elements make the moving elements land harder.
The moving elements make the still elements feel grounded.

**Motion budget = the set of intentional decisions about animation scope,
made BEFORE execution, that govern Agent-B's entire session.**

---

## STEP 1: ASSIGN A MOTION TIER

Based on Phase 0 project type + Brand Personality Matrix:

```
TIER 1 — RESTRAINED (Dashboards, functional apps, corporate sites)
  Brand: Bold ≤ 4, Avant-garde ≤ 4
  Budget: Minimal motion. State transitions only.
  Entry: Fade in/up on page sections — 0.3-0.4s max
  Scroll: No scroll-linked animation (only intersection triggers)
  Hover: Color shift, subtle lift (translateY -2px), no dramatic effects
  Never: Particle effects, cursor trails, magnetic buttons, scroll sequences

TIER 2 — PURPOSEFUL (Marketing sites, landing pages, product sites)
  Brand: Bold 5-7, Avant-garde 4-7
  Budget: Selective motion. 3-4 animated moments per scroll length.
  Entry: Section entrances with stagger — 0.5-0.7s
  Scroll: 1-2 scroll-triggered sequences (hero, key feature)
  Hover: Magnetic button available if bold ≥ 6
  Never: Full-page cursor WebGL, overwhelming particle systems

TIER 3 — EXPRESSIVE (Portfolios, campaigns, luxury/fashion brands)
  Brand: Bold 7-10, Avant-garde 6-10
  Budget: Rich motion. Scroll as primary narrative tool.
  Entry: Dramatic reveals — char/word stagger, clip-path, scale
  Scroll: Full scroll engine (60-frame sequences), pinned panels
  Hover: Magnetic cursor, trailing cursor, card tilt, image reveal on hover
  Cursor: Custom cursor with brand personality
  WebGL: Three.js if avant-garde ≥ 8

TIER 4 — IMMERSIVE (Creative studios, immersive campaigns, game-adjacent sites)
  Brand: Avant-garde 8-10, any bold score
  Budget: Maximum. Motion IS the content.
  Entry: Full page-level transitions (Barba.js or custom)
  Scroll: WebGL-driven scroll, camera movement, 3D product viewers
  Hover: Everything in Tier 3 plus shader effects
  Audio: Optional ambient sound layer (requires explicit permission)
```

## STEP 2: MOTION ZONES

Every page is divided into motion zones. Define them before building.

```
ZONE A: HERO (above fold)
  → ALWAYS animates. This is the first impression.
  → Budget: Richest animation on the page. Sets expectations.
  → Tier 1: Simple fade. Tier 2: Type reveal + image in.
  → Tier 3: Full text choreography + scroll-pinned panel or scroll sequence.

ZONE B: NARRATIVE SECTIONS (the scroll story)
  → Intersection Observer triggers (not scroll-linked unless Tier 3+).
  → Stagger reveals: text blocks, cards, image grids.
  → Rule: One motion "moment" per section. Not every element in the section.
  → The anchor: At least ONE element in each section should not animate.

ZONE C: INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS (CTAs, buttons, forms, navigation)
  → Hover states are always present (all tiers).
  → Tier 1: Color + underline. Tier 2: Magnetic + scale.
  → Tier 3: Full magnetic + cursor swap + GSAP tween on hover.

ZONE D: BACKGROUND LAYER (mesh, particles, Three.js scenes)
  → Only Tier 3-4.
  → Must not compete with foreground content.
  → Rule: Background motion slows when user is reading.
  → Rule: background motion speed ≤ 30% of foreground motion speed.

ZONE E: PAGE TRANSITIONS
  → Tier 1-2: Simple fade or slide (CSS transitions).
  → Tier 3-4: Barba.js page transitions with enter/leave hooks.
  → Budget: 0.4-0.8s max transition time. Never longer.
```

---

## STEP 3: WHAT NEVER MOVES (The Anchors)

Defining anchors is as important as defining what moves.

```
ALWAYS ANCHORED (no animation, all tiers):
  → Body text blocks being READ (do not scroll-link reading content)
  → Navigation (after initial entrance animation, nav is static)
  → Footer (subtle fade-in only — never animated per-element)
  → Price/CTA numbers (these must be stable for cognitive processing)

ANCHORED IN TIER 1-2 (animate only in Tier 3-4):
  → Section background elements
  → Large imagery (static in Tier 1-2, scroll-parallax only in Tier 3+)
  → Decorative borders and rule lines
```

---

## STEP 4: TIMING BUDGET

A timing budget prevents motion from feeling sluggish or chaotic.

```
MAXIMUM DURATIONS:
  Micro (hover states, focus rings):    0.2s
  Element entry (single):               0.5-0.7s
  Section entrance (staggered group):   0.7-1.2s total (not per element)
  Hero narrative sequence:              1.5-2.5s total
  Page transition:                      0.5-0.8s
  Scroll pinned sequence:               Governed by scroll distance, not time

STAGGER INTERVALS:
  Character-level:   0.015-0.025s per char
  Word-level:        0.04-0.07s per word
  Line-level:        0.08-0.12s per line
  Card-level:        0.06-0.10s per card
  Section-level:     0.12-0.18s per major element

EASING QUICK-SELECT:
  Entrance:          expo.out (fast start, smooth landing)
  Exit:              power2.in (smooth start, fast departure)
  Hover:             power1.inOut (symmetric, natural)
  Scroll-linked:     none (linear — let scroll position do the work)
  Spring/bounce:     elastic.out(1, 0.3) (sparingly — personality moments only)
```

## STEP 5: PERFORMANCE GATES

Motion budget must not break performance budget.

```
GATE 1: GPU COMPOSITING CHECK
  → Only animate: transform (translate/scale/rotate) and opacity
  → NEVER animate: top, left, width, height, margin, padding, border-width
  → will-change: transform — set immediately before animation, clear in onComplete

GATE 2: REDUCE MOTION RESPECT
  → ALL animations must be gated by prefers-reduced-motion
  → Implementation:
    const motionOK = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)').matches;
    if (motionOK) { /* run full GSAP timeline */ }
    else { /* show content immediately, no animation */ }

GATE 3: SCROLL SEQUENCE WEIGHT
  → If using image frame sequences: max 60 frames at WebP compression
  → Must lazy-load: only frames ±10 from current position in memory
  → Always provide video fallback for mobile (canvas/frame sequences heavy)

GATE 4: SCROLL TRIGGER CLEANUP
  → All ScrollTrigger instances must be stored and killed on route change
  → const triggers = []; ... triggers.push(ScrollTrigger.create({...}));
  → On cleanup: triggers.forEach(t => t.kill());
```

## INTEGRATION POINT: feel-profile.json

Phase 2 output must include:

```json
{
  "motion": {
    "tier": "1 | 2 | 3 | 4",
    "hero_animation": "fade | type-reveal | full-choreography | immersive",
    "scroll_sequences": false,
    "magnetic_cursor": false,
    "three_js": false,
    "page_transitions": false,
    "prefers_reduced_motion_fallback": true,
    "motion_notes": "any special constraints or opportunities"
  }
}
```

Agent-B reads this before writing a single GSAP line.
Orchestrator uses this to decide whether to spawn Agent-D (scroll sequences).
