  Sub-skill 4 of 4 in the Iron Canvas Master pipeline.
  The 5-axis quality audit that validates the implementation against Awwwards design
  standards, animation quality, aesthetic taste, performance, and brand DNA fidelity.
  Run as the final step. If any axis fails, routes back to the appropriate Protocol.
  Produces verification_report.json and the final PASS/REFINE verdict.
  
  Triggers: "verify the design", "quality check", "run the audit",
  "is this ready", "grade the output", "final check", "sign off"

# IRON CANVAS — PROTOCOL 4: VERIFICATION NEXUS
### *5-Axis Quality Audit & Final Sign-Off*

> **Simulate three critical perspectives simultaneously:**
> 1. An Awwwards judge evaluating for Site of the Day
> 2. A principal engineer reviewing for production readiness
> 3. An accessibility auditor reviewing for inclusive design
>
> **Be honest. Sycophancy here is expensive. A failed gate caught now
> costs hours. A failed gate caught after delivery costs days.**

## AXIS 1 — AWWWARDS DESIGN SCORE
*"Would this win Site of the Day?"*

Score each criterion 1-10 (Awwwards scale):

```
DESIGN
  Visual impact and uniqueness:          __/10
  Color and typography sophistication:   __/10
  Spatial composition:                   __/10
  Aesthetic coherence:                   __/10
  DESIGN AVERAGE:                        __/10

USABILITY
  Navigation clarity:                    __/10
  Content hierarchy:                     __/10
  Mobile experience:                     __/10
  Loading and performance feel:          __/10
  USABILITY AVERAGE:                     __/10

  Hierarchy guides attention:            __/10
  CONTENT AVERAGE:                       __/10

AWWWARDS TOTAL: __ /10 (average of 4 averages)
```

**Scoring thresholds:**
- 9.0+: Exceptional — potential SOTD winner
- 8.0-8.9: Excellent — strong honorable mention
- 7.5-7.9: ✅ PRODUCTION READY — minimum for delivery
- 7.0-7.4: ⚠️ NEEDS WORK — specific improvements required
- < 7.0: ❌ FAIL — significant redesign needed

**If < 7.5:** Document exactly which criteria scored low and WHY.
→ Return to Protocol 3 Phase 3 (Polish) or Protocol 1 (if it's a DNA issue)

---

## AXIS 2 — ANIMATION QUALITY AUDIT
*"Does the motion serve the story, or is it noise?"*

Check each question (✓ Pass / ✗ Fail):

```
□ Every animation has a PURPOSE (not just decoration)?
□ Animations are CONSISTENT (same easing family throughout)?
□ Timing is CALIBRATED (nothing too fast, nothing too slow)?
□ Scroll animations FEEL PHYSICAL (weight, momentum)?
□ Load animations complete by 1.5s?
□ Motion SUPPORTS brand personality (intensity matches matrix)?
□ No JANKY moments (layout shifts, repaints, drops)?
□ SMOOTH on mobile (60fps or graceful degradation)?
□ Satisfying HIERARCHY of moments (big + small)?
□ Does the animation make you WANT TO KEEP SCROLLING?
```

**Score: 10/10 = Perfect | 9/10 = Excellent | ≥7/10 = ✅ PASS**
**< 7/10 = ❌ FAIL → Return to Protocol 3 Phase 2 for specific animation revisions**

**Document each ✗ with specific remediation:**
```
FAIL: [which animation]
PROBLEM: [what's wrong]
FIX: [specific code change needed]
```

---

## AXIS 3 — THE TASTE TEST
*"Would a senior designer at a top creative agency be proud of this?"*

This is the most uncompromising gate. All 7 must pass.

### T1: FONT CHOICE
Is the typography DESIGNED or DEFAULTED?
```
PASS criteria:
- Display font is distinctive, not generic (Inter/Roboto/Arial = FAIL for creative sites)
- Font pairing has contrast and intentionality
- Letter-spacing and weight choices feel crafted

Status: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
Evidence: [what you see]
Fix if fail: [replace font, adjust specs]
```

### T2: COLOR DRAMA
Does the palette have TENSION and CHARACTER?
```
PASS criteria:
- Not all neutrals — at least one accent that actually pops
- Color communicates an emotion before words are read
- No "safe beige everything" or "corporate blue everything"

Status: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
Evidence: [what you see]
Fix if fail: [which color needs replacing/strengthening]
```

### T3: UNEXPECTED DETAIL
Is there at least ONE thing that surprises?
```
PASS criteria:
- A section header that behaves unexpectedly
- A hover interaction that produces delight
- A background that rewards close attention
- An animation sequence that makes someone say "wait, show me that again"

Status: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
Evidence: [what the surprise is]
Fix if fail: [add specific interaction/detail]
```

### T4: THE SLOW SCROLL TEST
Scroll the complete page slowly. Does EVERY section feel intentional?
```
PASS criteria:
- No section feels "leftover" or half-finished
- No section that could have been removed without loss
- Transitions between sections feel designed

Status: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
Problem sections: [list any that feel weak]
Fix: [specific improvements]
```

### T5: THE SCREENSHOT TEST
Take a screenshot. Would you share this as an example of good design?
```
PASS criteria:
- Would appear on Dribbble / Awwwards without embarrassment
- Has at least one visual element worth studying
- Layout is not "AI default" (centered stack, purple gradients, generic cards)

Status: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
Evidence: [what makes it shareable / what holds it back]
```

### T6: THE COMPETITOR TEST
Compare to the top 3 competitors in this space.
```
PASS criteria:
- Demonstrably better, or at minimum equal on 4/5 dimensions
- Has at least 1 dimension where it clearly wins

Status: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
Competitor comparison: [brief 3-way comparison]
```

### T7: THE 5-SECOND TEST
Can a new viewer understand the purpose AND feel the intended emotion within 5 seconds?
```
PASS criteria:
- Primary purpose clear from hero without scrolling
- Emotional register (calm/exciting/trustworthy/edgy) immediately felt
- No confusion about what this site is or does

Status: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
Evidence: [what communicates well / what's confusing]
Fix: [hero/headline/visual adjustments]
```

**TASTE TEST RESULT:**
- 7/7: ✅ PASS
- Any single ✗: ❌ FAIL → Fix the specific item(s) before proceeding

---

## AXIS 4 — PERFORMANCE & TECHNICAL AUDIT
*"Is this production-ready?"*

```
□ Lighthouse Performance score ≥ 85?
□ Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5 seconds?
□ Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1?
□ No console errors in production build?
□ Works in Chrome + Firefox + Safari + Edge (latest 2 versions)?
□ Mobile tested at 375px viewport?
□ All images: WebP format, lazy-loaded, width+height set?
□ Fonts: preloaded, font-display: swap?
□ JS bundle: no unexpectedly large dependencies?
□ CSS: no unused variables or duplicate declarations?
□ Only transform + opacity animated (no layout triggers)?
□ Memory: event listeners cleaned up, Three.js disposed (if used)?
```

**Score: 12/12 = Perfect | ≥10/12 = ✅ PASS | 8-9/12 = ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE with notes**
**< 8/12 = ❌ FAIL → Return to Protocol 3 Phase 1 performance section**

---

## AXIS 5 — BRAND DNA FAITHFULNESS
*"Does this look like it belongs to this brand?"*

Cross-reference `design_brief.json` against the implementation:

```
□ Every defined color used correctly?
□ Display font used at correct weights and sizes?
□ Body font used with correct line-height and measure?
□ Spacing system consistent with defined base unit?
□ Motion easing matches motion_personality defined in DNA?
□ Target audience would respond correctly to this?
□ Emotional intent from Intent Archaeology comes through clearly?
```

**Score: 7/7 = Perfect DNA match | 5-6/7 = ✅ Minor drift acceptable**
**< 5/7 = ❌ Identity crisis → Refactor tokens and revisit Protocol 1**

| Axis 2 (Animation) | Specific animations janky/purposeless | Protocol 3 → Phase 2 |
| Axis 3 T1 (Fonts) | Generic typography | Protocol 3 → token system |
| Axis 3 T2 (Color) | No drama or tension | Protocol 3 → color tokens |
| Axis 3 T3 (Surprise) | Nothing memorable | Protocol 2 → add micro-interaction |
| Axis 3 T4-T7 | Weak sections/communication | Protocol 3 → targeted polish |
| Axis 4 (Performance) | Speed/technical issues | Protocol 3 → Phase 1 performance |
