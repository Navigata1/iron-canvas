## § ARTIFACT ASSESSMENT GATE
### *Run at the start of every Phase 5. Score to decide.*

This gate is what was missing. It was the reason Phase 5 kept getting skipped.
Every run of Iron Canvas must pause here and explicitly decide.

### ASSESSMENT CRITERIA (score each 1-5)

```
CRITERION 1: IMAGE ABSENCE
  Does the site have ZERO product/hero/atmospheric images?
  Score 5: No images at all (like Crown Collection — pure CSS)
  Score 3: Some images but weak/generic/missing context
  Score 1: Rich, high-quality existing imagery throughout

CRITERION 2: VISUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITY
  Is there a product, ingredient, process, or concept that NEEDS
  to be shown to be understood/desired?
  Score 5: Physical product (Crown Collection body butter), clear visual sell
  Score 3: Service/concept (partially visual)
  Score 1: Pure information/text service (no visual anchor needed)

CRITERION 3: SCROLL SEQUENCE VIABILITY
  Is there a natural reveal/story that 120+ frames would tell?
  Score 5: YES — product has opening, transformation, reveal, texture
  Score 3: MAYBE — a process or journey could be scrolled through
  Score 1: NO — the content is best delivered statically

CRITERION 4: COMPETITIVE PREMIUM GAP
  Are competitors using cinematic imagery/animation you're not matching?
  Score 5: YES — you look cheap next to them without it
  Score 3: SOME — would help but not critical
  Score 1: NO — industry standard is text-forward

CRITERION 5: BRAND PERSONALITY ALIGNMENT
  Does the Brand Personality Matrix support generated artifacts?
  Score 5: Bold ≥ 7, Avant-garde ≥ 6, Maximal ≥ 6 → strongly yes
  Score 3: Mixed scores → conditional
  Score 1: Serious + Corporate + Minimal → artifacts would feel wrong
```

### CONFIDENCE SCORE + DECISION

```
TOTAL POSSIBLE: 25

Score 20-25: ✅ GENERATE — mandatory. Site needs artifacts urgently.
             → Run full Phase 5 pipeline. Scroll engine likely needed.
             → Open Chrome. Access app.leonardo.ai. Execute Blueprint workflow.

Score 13-19: ✅ GENERATE — recommended. At least hero/product images.
             → Run Phase 5 for high-priority artifacts.
             → Assess scroll engine in Phase 6.

Score 8-12:  ⚠️ CONDITIONAL — one or two targeted artifacts.
             → Generate only the specific artifacts that would most elevate.
             → No scroll engine unless Criterion 3 scored ≥ 3.

Score 1-7:   ❌ SKIP — document rationale and proceed to Phase 6.
             → Record: artifact-assessment.json with rationale.
             → Phase 6 still runs (scroll engine may not be needed either).
```

## § PHASE 5 ROUTING DECISION TREE
### *Load these specific files based on what was decided*

```
Phase 5 entry → READ phases/05-generate.md

Run ARTIFACT ASSESSMENT GATE → produces artifact-assessment.json

IF decision = GENERATE or CONDITIONAL:

  FOR STILL IMAGES (product shots, hero images, atmosphere):
    1. READ references/model-selection.md     ← which engine to use
    2. READ references/prompt-engineering.md  ← how to craft the prompt
    3. INJECT into Agent-D:
       references/expertise-injection.md      ← Nano Banana section
    4. Run Agent-D: agent-prompts/agent-d-artifacts.md

  FOR LEONARDO AI WORK (Product Spin, Relight, Style Transfer):
    1. READ references/leonardo-blueprints.md
    2. OPEN CHROME → navigate to app.leonardo.ai
       (See § LEONARDO BROWSER PROTOCOL below)
    3. Run Blueprint workflow → download output
    4. Hand off to ffmpeg frame extraction if scroll sequence

  FOR SCROLL SEQUENCE (120+ frames, Apple-style):
    1. READ references/scroll-engine.md       ← full architecture
    2. READ references/prompt-engineering.md  ← frame consistency protocol
    3. INJECT Nano Banana Pro expertise into Agent-D
    4. Generate 10-frame prototype FIRST
    5. Validate scroll scrub → then generate full set
    6. Pass frames to Agent-B for scroll engine implementation

IF decision = SKIP:
  Document in artifact-assessment.json
  PROCEED directly to Phase 6
```

---

## § PHASE 6 ROUTING DECISION TREE

```
Phase 6 entry → READ phases/06-compose.md

FOR IMAGE INTEGRATION:
  1. Place artifact in page
  2. Screenshot in context
  3. Evaluate blend (3 questions from phases/06-compose.md)
  4. Apply CSS from artifact-css.css (Agent-D output)
  5. If doesn't blend → back to Agent-D → regenerate

FOR SCROLL ENGINE ASSEMBLY:
  1. READ references/scroll-engine.md         ← LOAD THIS FULLY
  2. INJECT into Agent-B:
     references/expertise-injection.md        ← GSAP section
  3. Agent-B implements scroll-engine.js
  4. Test 10-frame scrub before full deploy
  5. Add content overlays from PRD timing

FOR PAGE TRANSITIONS:
  1. INJECT into Agent-B:
     references/expertise-injection.md        ← Barba.js section
  2. Agent-B implements transitions.js

FOR WEBGL (if justified):
  1. INJECT into Agent-B:
     references/expertise-injection.md        ← Three.js section
  2. Agent-B implements webgl.js
```

## § LEONARDO BROWSER PROTOCOL
### *Mandatory for Crown Collection-type sites with physical products*

> OpenClaw has access to your Mac's Chrome browser.
> Do NOT wait for Jon to come home. Open Chrome yourself.
> Navigate to app.leonardo.ai. Execute the Blueprint workflow.

### BROWSER AUTOMATION STEPS

```
STEP 1: Open Chrome
  Open a new Chrome window or tab

STEP 2: Navigate to Leonardo AI
  URL: https://app.leonardo.ai/

STEP 3: Log in (if not already logged in)
  Use stored credentials or prompt user for login

STEP 4: Navigate to Blueprints
  Click "Blueprints" in the left sidebar or
  Navigate to: https://app.leonardo.ai/blueprints

STEP 5: Select the appropriate Blueprint
  For product stills:        "Product Studio Photoshoot"
  For lifestyle shots:       "Product In Scene"
  For scroll sequence:       "Product Spin Video"
  For palette matching:      "Style Transfer"
  For frame consistency:     "Custom Relight"
  For background context:    "Background Change"
  For container expansion:   "Instant Outpaint"

STEP 6: Upload reference image or provide prompt
  Upload: existing product photo if available
  OR: provide base image from Nano Banana Pro generation

STEP 7: Configure and run
  Adjust settings per references/leonardo-blueprints.md
  Click Run / Generate

STEP 8: Download outputs
  Download all generated images to project's /public/images/iron-canvas/ folder
  OR directly to /frames/ for scroll sequences

STEP 9: Frame extraction (if Product Spin Video)
  ffmpeg -i spin.mp4 -vf "fps=24,scale=1920:1080" frames/frame_%04d.webp
  ffmpeg -i spin.mp4 -vf "fps=24,scale=960:540" frames-mobile/frame_%04d.webp
```

### CHROME AUTOMATION FALLBACK (if browser automation unavailable)

If Chrome automation is blocked or unavailable:
1. Use Leonardo AI API directly (see references/leonardo-blueprints.md § API Access)
2. Or use Nano Banana Pro exclusively for all artifact generation
3. Document which Leonardo workflows were skipped and why

```bash
# Leonardo API (programmatic)
curl -X POST https://cloud.leonardo.ai/api/rest/v1/blueprints/{id}/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LEONARDO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"nodeInputs": {"imageUrl": "...", "prompt": "..."}}'
```

## § QUICK DECISION ROUTING
### *Which phases to emphasize based on what's missing*

```
"Site has no images at all"
  → Artifact Assessment will score 18-25
  → Phase 5 is MANDATORY
  → Check: does the product warrant scroll sequence?
  → Crown Collection = YES (body butter reveal is cinematic)

"Site has images but they're stock/generic"
  → Artifact Assessment will score 13-17
  → Phase 5: replace hero + product shots with AI-generated
  → Leonardo Style Transfer against existing brand palette
  → Scroll sequence: assess per Criterion 3

"Site needs interactivity but has images"
  → Artifact Assessment may score 8-12
  → Phase 5: skip or minimal (one targeted artifact)
  → Phase 6: focus on scroll engine + page transitions

"Site is text-forward (law firm, news, docs)"
  → Artifact Assessment will score 1-7
  → Phase 5: SKIP with documented rationale
  → Phase 6: no scroll engine needed
  → Focus: tokens + micro-interactions + typography

"Product configurator / automotive style"
  → Type D project (e-commerce / luxury product)
  → Research: Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Koenigsegg websites
  → Phase 3 SCOUT: scrape those sites for code patterns
  → Phase 5: 3D product renders + color variant shots
  → Phase 6: scroll sequence + THREE.JS product configurator
  → References: scroll-engine.md + model-selection.md + leonardo-blueprints.md
```

## § AUTOMOTIVE / LUXURY CONFIGURATOR ROUTE
### *Research standard for Crown Collection-type premium product builds*

When the brief calls for Porsche/Lamborghini/Ferrari-level product experience:

**Phase 3 SCOUT — Research these specific sites:**
```
Primary references (inspect their code):
  porsche.com          - Scroll-driven hero, product configurator, GSAP
  lamborghini.com      - Canvas animations, cinematic sections
  ferrari.com          - Editorial grid, video backgrounds, luxury type
  koenigsegg.com       - Immersive scroll, 3D elements, dark luxury
  rimac-automobiles.com - Award-winning dark tech luxury

Technique catalog to extract:
  - How does the product configurator work? (color selector → 3D update)
  - What scroll technique drives the hero reveal?
  - How are product variants displayed? (carousel vs. overlay vs. scroll)
  - What is the color/material selector interaction?
  - How does the page transition between models/configurations?
```

**Phase 5 GENERATE — Artifacts needed:**
```
For product configurator:
  1. Product hero shot (angle 1 — front, closed, sealed)
  2. Product hero shot (angle 2 — 3/4 view)
  3. Product close-up (texture, material, lid detail)
  4. Color/variant shots (one per SKU)
  5. Lifestyle context shot (in use, environment-placed)
  6. Ingredient/component explosion (for scroll sequence)

All generated with:
  - Consistent lighting (Leonardo Custom Relight)
  - Consistent background (deep brand-palette color)
  - Consistent angle (Leonardo Product Studio Photoshoot)
  - Style matched to North Star (Leonardo Style Transfer)
```

**Phase 6 COMPOSE — Build:**
```
  - Product selector: CSS Grid + GSAP Flip for variant switching
  - Canvas scroll sequence: product reveal (Apple/Koenigsegg pattern)
  - 3D product view: Three.js (only if bold ≥ 8 + avant-garde ≥ 8)
  - Configurator logic: color/size/scent selector → product image swap + GSAP Flip
```
